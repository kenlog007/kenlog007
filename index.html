Build. Learn. Document. Repeat.
Hi, I’m Ken — a builder, indie hacker, and digital explorer documenting my journey of creating and operating overseas products. I use this space to log learnings, wins, and pain points — especially from working with platforms like Google Play Console, Gumroad, ad networks, and obscure foreign APIs that almost never work on the first try.

🚀 What I Do
	•	📱 Overseas Mobile App Development Documenting the full lifecycle from Google Play setup、region & tax challenges、to ASO experiments
	•	🛠️ AI Tools & Micro SaaS Rapid experiments in AI companions, automation tools, and niche SaaS workflows
	•	🌍 Cross-border Ops / Compliance Notes Real-world frictions: payment onboarding, KYC/AML blockers, translation challenges, and more
	•	🧪 Traffic Experiments & Monetization Loops Google Ads arbitrage, SEO site monetization, CTR optimization experiments

📚 Highlighted Logs
	•	✅ How I navigated Google Play identity verification in China
	•	🔍 Comparing Stripe vs Gumroad vs Creem for solo devs
	•	🌐 Building an AI chatbot and scaling via Reddit + Product Hunt
	•	🚫 When Google disabled my ad account and how I appealed
(Actual links coming soon — this repo is a WIP!)

🧠 Philosophy
"Documenting isn’t bragging — it’s building in public. And surviving in overseas terrain is already a superpower."
