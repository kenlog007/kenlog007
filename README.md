**Build. Learn. Document. Repeat.**

Hi, I’m **Ken** — a builder, indie hacker, and digital explorer documenting my journey of creating and operating overseas products. I use this space to log learnings, wins, and pain points — especially from working with platforms like Google Play Console, Gumroad, ad networks, and obscure foreign APIs that almost never work on the first try.

### 🚀 What I Do

- 📱 **Overseas Mobile App Development**  
  Documenting the full lifecycle from Google Play setup、region & tax challenges、to ASO experiments

- 🛠️ **AI Tools & Micro SaaS**  
  Rapid experiments in AI companions, automation tools, and niche SaaS workflows

- 🌍 **Cross-border Ops / Compliance Notes**  
  Real-world frictions: payment onboarding, KYC/AML blockers, translation challenges, and more

- 🧪 **Traffic Experiments & Monetization Loops**  
  Google Ads arbitrage, SEO site monetization, CTR optimization experiments

> _"Documenting isn’t bragging — it’s building in public. And surviving in overseas terrain is already a superpower."_
